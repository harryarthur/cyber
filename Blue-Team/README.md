# Blue Team Work

This folder contains my hands-on blue team and defensive security work, including:

- Log analysis exercises using Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, and Apache logs
- Detection experiments using tools like Wazuh, HELK, or ELK Stack
- Basic Sigma rule examples and alert development
- Simulated attack detection using Atomic Red Team or similar frameworks

All work here is based on practical labs, self-study, and sandbox experimentation to better understand how to detect and respond to adversarial activity.
