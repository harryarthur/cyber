# Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Work

This folder contains sample documents and exercises related to GRC frameworks and concepts, including:

- Mock cybersecurity policies (e.g., Acceptable Use Policy, Password Policy)
- Risk assessments mapped to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- ISO 27001 control mappings and gap analysis examples
- Notes on regulatory compliance practices and audit prep

All documents are created for demonstration and learning purposes as I prepare for roles involving cyber risk management and compliance.
