What are the seven layers of the OSI model?	Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application.
What are the four layers of the TCP/IP model?	Link, Internet, Transport, Application.
Which OSI layer is responsible for routing?	The Network layer.
Which OSI layer ensures reliable transmission of data?	The Transport layer.
At which OSI layer does a switch operate?	The Data Link layer.
At which OSI layer does a router operate?	The Network layer.
What is encapsulation in networking?	The process of wrapping data with protocol-specific information before transmission.
What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?	IPv4 is a 32-bit address space, IPv6 is a 128-bit address space.
What is CIDR notation?	A shorthand for representing IP addresses and their associated routing prefix.
How many hosts can a /24 subnet support?	254 usable hosts.
What is the purpose of a subnet mask?	To divide an IP address into network and host portions.
What is a private IP address?	An IP address reserved for internal use, not routable on the internet (e.g., 192.168.0.0/16).
What is the purpose of the ARP protocol?	To map an IP address to a MAC address.
What is the difference between TCP and UDP?	TCP is connection-oriented and reliable; UDP is connectionless and faster but unreliable.
What port does DNS use?	UDP port 53 (TCP 53 for zone transfers).
What port does HTTP use?	TCP port 80.
What port does HTTPS use?	TCP port 443.
What port does SSH use?	TCP port 22.
What protocol is used to assign IP addresses dynamically?	DHCP.
What protocol is used to resolve domain names to IP addresses?	DNS.
What is the difference between a switch and a router?	A switch connects devices within the same network; a router connects different networks.
What is a default gateway?	The IP address of the router a host uses to access other networks.
What is NAT?	Network Address Translation – translates private IPs to a public IP for internet access.
What is the difference between static and dynamic routing?	Static routes are manually configured; dynamic routes are automatically learned.
What is SSID in wireless networking?	Service Set Identifier – the name of a Wi-Fi network.
What is WPA2?	Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 – a security protocol for wireless networks.
What is MAC filtering?	Restricting network access based on device MAC addresses.
What does the 'ping' command do?	Tests network connectivity to a specific IP address or hostname.
What does the 'traceroute' or 'tracert' command do?	Shows the path packets take to reach a destination.
What does the 'nslookup' command do?	Queries DNS to obtain domain name or IP address mappings.
What does the 'ipconfig' or 'ifconfig' command do?	Displays network interface configuration on a host.
What is a VLAN?	Virtual Local Area Network – a logical segmentation of a network.
What is MTU?	Maximum Transmission Unit – the largest packet size that can be transmitted.
What is a broadcast domain?	A network segment in which a broadcast packet is forwarded to all devices.
