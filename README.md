# CYBER

Hi, I'm Harry ‚Äî currently working in IT while pursuing a Master‚Äôs in Cybersecurity. I'm hoping for a pivot into roles in:

- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Threat Intelligence  
- üõ°Ô∏è Blue Team / Defensive Security  
- üìã Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)

This repository showcases my practical work and learning in these areas. It includes labs, reports, policies, detection rules, and hands-on exercises designed to help demonstrate my readiness for junior or entry-level cybersecurity roles.

---
##Current status: 1/25 deliverables complete.## 

## üìÇ Folder Structure

- `Threat-Intelligence/`  
  IOC reports, threat actor profiles, MITRE ATT&CK mappings, and OSINT analysis.

- `Blue-Team/`  
  Log analysis, SIEM setups (like Wazuh/HELK), detection rules, and simulation notes.

- `GRC/`  
  Sample policies, risk assessments, and framework mappings (NIST CSF, ISO 27001).

---

## üéØ Goal

To use this portfolio as a learning tool and a way to demonstrate initiative and capability while preparing for career opportunities in cyber threat intelligence, blue teaming, or GRC.
