Hi, I'm Harry — currently working in IT while pursuing a Master’s in Cybersecurity. I'm hoping for a pivot into roles in:

- 🕵️‍♂️ Threat Intelligence  
- 🛡️ Blue Team / Defensive Security  
- 📋 Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)

This repository showcases my practical work and learning in these areas. It includes labs, reports, policies, detection rules, and hands-on exercises designed to help demonstrate my readiness for junior or entry-level cybersecurity roles.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- `Threat-Intelligence/`  
  IOC reports, threat actor profiles, MITRE ATT&CK mappings, and OSINT analysis.

- `Blue-Team/`  
  Log analysis, SIEM setups (like Wazuh/HELK), detection rules, and simulation notes.

- `GRC/`  
  Sample policies, risk assessments, and framework mappings (NIST CSF, ISO 27001).

## 🎯 Goal

To use this portfolio as a learning tool and a way to demonstrate initiative and capability while preparing for career opportunities in cyber threat intelligence, blue teaming, or GRC.
