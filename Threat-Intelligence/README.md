# Threat Intelligence Work

This folder contains my learning and practical work related to cyber threat intelligence, including:

- IOC reports based on malware samples and phishing emails
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping exercises
- Threat actor profiling based on public reporting

All exercises were created during my self-study and lab work.
